      Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
    </p>
    <p>"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonsuawl.</p>
    <p>"I am."</p>
    <p>"Now?"</p>
    <p>"Now," said Deep Thought.</p>
    <p>They both licked their dry lips.</p>
    <p>"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought. "that you're going to like it."</p>
    <p>"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"</p>
    <p>"Now?" inquired Deep Thought.</p>
    <p>"Yes! Now..."</p>
    <p>"All right," said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.</p>
    <p>"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.</p>
    <p>"Tell us!"</p>
    <p>"All right," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question..."</p>
    <p>"Yes..!"</p>
    <p>"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought.</p>
    <p>"Yes...!"</p>
    <p>"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused.</p>
    <p>"Yes...!"</p>
    <p>"Is..."</p>
    <p>"Yes...!!!...?"</p>
    <p>"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.</p>
